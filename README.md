`herdr-snatch` is a fuzzy picker for text already on your Herdr screen. Search it with `fzf`, then insert, copy, or open the result.

## Why herdr-snatch?

Mouse selection across split panes works, but I kept grabbing one slash too many. [tmux-extrakto](https://github.com/laktak/extrakto) gave me the idea: put an `fzf` picker over Herdr and send the selection back to the pane that opened it.

## Install

You need Herdr 0.8.2 or newer, Python 3.9 or newer, and `fzf`.

```sh
herdr plugin install catlee/herdr-snatch
```

Add this to `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`:

```toml
[keys]
cycle_pane_next = "prefix+alt+o" # free up prefix+Tab

[[keys.command]]
key = "prefix+tab"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "herdr-snatch.open"
description = "Pick text from pane output"
```

If you already have a `[keys]` section, add `cycle_pane_next` there instead of creating another one. Then run `herdr server reload-config`.

## Quick start

Say the build has just printed a file path:

```text
$ cargo build
error: src/parser/rules.rs
$ vim █

prefix+Tab  →  type pars  →  Enter

$ vim src/parser/rules.rs█
```

## Keys

| Key | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `prefix+Tab` | Open the picker |
| Type, `↑`, `↓` | Search and move through matches |
| `Enter` or `Tab` | Insert in the pane that opened the picker, without running the command |
| `Ctrl-Y` | Copy to the system clipboard |
| `Ctrl-O` | Open a URL or local path in its default app |
| `Esc` | Cancel |
| `Ctrl-P`, `Ctrl-T`, `Ctrl-W` | Search one pane, the current tab, or the workspace |
| `Ctrl-V`, `Ctrl-R` | Search visible screens or retained scrollback |

The popup shows the current search scope. Switching scope keeps your query. It starts at **tab/visible**. To change that default, put a `settings.json` file in the directory printed by `herdr plugin config-dir herdr-snatch`:

```json
{"scope": "pane", "source": "scrollback"}
```

Valid scopes are `pane`, `tab`, and `workspace`; sources are `visible` and `scrollback`. Omit either setting to keep its default.

## Search scope and candidates

The picker pulls text from Herdr with `pane read`, then extracts paths, URLs, hex hashes, words, and whole non-empty lines. Duplicates are removed, with the originating pane searched first. `fzf` ranks matches against what you type. Scrollback reads up to 10 million rendered rows per pane, bounded by what Herdr retains. Large histories can take longer; lower `SCROLLBACK_LINES` in the script if that becomes annoying.

Insert sends the selected text literally to the original pane. It doesn't press Enter or add shell quotes. Copy passes the exact text to `wl-copy` (Wayland), `xclip` (X11), or `pbcopy` (macOS). Open uses `xdg-open` (Linux) or `open` (macOS); relative paths are resolved from the original pane's working directory and must exist. These commands run on the machine hosting the Herdr popup, which matters if you're using a remote session.

## Openers

`Ctrl-O` checks the selection against a list of openers before falling back to URLs and paths. Out of the box, `owner/repo#123` opens on GitHub.

Run `herdr plugin config-dir herdr-snatch` to find the plugin's config directory. Create or edit `settings.json` there (normally `~/.config/herdr/plugins/config/herdr-snatch/settings.json`), and add your own under `"openers"`. Keep any existing `scope` and `source` settings in the same file. Changes take effect the next time you open the picker.

```json
{"openers": [
  {"name": "Ticket", "priority": 100, "match": "(?:TICKET|ticket)[ -]#?(?P<number>\\d+)",
   "url": "https://tickets.example.com/{number}"},
  {"name": "Ticket (bare number)", "match": "#?(?P<number>\\d+)",
   "command": ["open-ticket", "{number}"]}
]}
```

- `match` is a Python regex that must match the whole selection. Its named groups fill `{placeholders}` in `url` or `command`, and `defaults` supplies values for groups that didn't match.
- Each opener has exactly one of `url` (opened with `open` or `xdg-open`) or `command` (an argument list run as-is, without a shell).
- When the highest `priority` belongs to one opener, it opens right away. When several openers tie for the top, a second picker asks which one to use, listing them in config order. `priority` defaults to 0.
- An opener with the same `name` as a built-in replaces it.

A word followed by a number, like `PR #123` or `task 42`, becomes a picker candidate when some opener matches it. Bare numbers are always candidates.

### Open PRs in the current repository

Use `{git_repo_url}` to open a PR number against the Git repository in the originating pane's working directory:

```json
{"openers": [
  {"name": "GitHub PR", "match": "(?:PR\\s+#?|#?)(?P<number>\\d+)",
   "url": "{git_repo_url}/pull/{number}"}
]}
```

This matches `PR #123`, `#123`, and `123`. The plugin prefers the `upstream` remote, then `origin`, then the only remaining remote. Set `"git_remote": "origin"` on the opener to choose a remote explicitly.

HTTPS and SSH remotes become browser URLs with the trailing `.git` removed. For example, `git@github.com:owner/repo.git` becomes `https://github.com/owner/repo`. Subdirectories and Git worktrees work too. The field is available in both `url` and `command` templates, and Git is queried only when the opener needs it. Missing repositories, ambiguous remotes, and local filesystem remotes produce an error when opening.

The URL suffix is up to the opener; `/pull/{number}` is for GitHub. Tab and workspace searches still use the originating pane's repository, even when the selected text came from another pane.

## Development

Link a local checkout instead of installing from GitHub:

```sh
herdr plugin link .
```

Herdr reads scripts from the linked checkout. After changing `herdr-plugin.toml`, unlink and link it again. Herdr won't install a GitHub copy over a local link; run `herdr plugin unlink herdr-snatch` first when switching back. There are no Python packages to install. Run the tests with:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

CI runs the same tests on Python 3.9 and 3.14. The code is under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

To rebuild the demo on Linux, install `ffmpeg` and `uv`, then run:

```sh
uv run --with pyte --with pillow python demo/record.py
```
